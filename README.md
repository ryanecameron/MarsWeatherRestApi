# MarsWeatherRestAPI




## Description
This program stores data taken from the NASA Insight
open API and stores it in a simple implementation of a 
Rest API using Python and Flask. This will allow users to
access a wider range of data points, since the NASA Insight 
API online provides data for the last seven available Sols.
The goal is to continually update the data on a frequent basis,
so that it can be stored and accessed later on.
